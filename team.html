      <p id="dp">
        In our design, a series of faces are depicted, each with the ability to display different expressions. These
        faces
        respond to collisions with other particles based on their colour, creating a metaphorical representation of the
        emotions experienced in social interactions.
        This aspect of the design reflects the emergent property of social connections, where the interactions between
        individuals can lead to the emergence of positive emotions and a sense of belonging. Just as in society, when we
        meet like-minded individuals or compatible friends, happiness emerges from collective interactions. This
        portrayal
        resonates with the idea that social dynamics are not simply the sum of individual interactions, but rather a
        complex emergence of patterns and emotions that arise from those interactions.

          the colours of the two particle belong to the same colour group, they will become happy.</li>

        <li>3.If the colours of the two particles do not belong to the same colour group, they will become angry and

        <li>4.Each click creates a barrier at the mouse position. If 10 barriers already exist, the earliest created
          barrier
          will be removed to maintain a maximum of 10 barriers.</li>
        <br>
        <li>5.When the particle collides with a barrier, they will change their direction of movement. Small bubbles are
          created at the point of collision to simulate the sensation of impact.
